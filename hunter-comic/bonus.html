      <br>• The main characters! I never gave them official names, but in my head I called them <b>"Doctor"</b> and <b>"Hunter"</b> respectively.
      <br>• Hunter was an old character I've had since 2018, and she's gone through a lot of design, personality, and story iterations. She was a "main character" in my head, and still had amnesia but used to be meaner/more violent and monstrous, and her story was about her exploring a fantasy world.
      <br>• Doctor was one of several of her love interests, but was the one I got the most attached to and turned into a full charcter.
      <br>• I designed Doctor's outfits first, then designed Hunter's around the idea that Doctor would be making her clothes (and therefore dressing Hunter in a similar style to herself)</p>

      <p class="desc">
      <br>• The Queen's Guard character also never got a name, but I called them <b>"Guard"</b> in my head. They were the hardest to design since they were created just for this story (rather than repurposing an old character).
      <br>• The two side characters who accompanied "Guard" in the Autumn chapter are also new characters, but I got attached to them as I wrote them in haha. In my head, the shorter one is the son of the local lord (but a younger sibling, won't inherit) and joined the hunt to prove himself. The taller one is his childhood friend and his bodyguard.
      <br>• It occurs to me that they look sort of similar to Doctor and Hunter... a stern-looking shorter character and a nice quiet taller character (I have a ship type??)
      <br>• I tried to give Guard and the villagers different elements in their clothes (Villagers + main characters: lots of circles and rectangles, natural-looking colors, simpler embroidery and layering. Guard: Pointy, star/sun like patterns, unnatural looking colors, complex).
      <br>• I had just watched some fashion history youtube video that said that in medieval times richer people/people in cities wore more "on-trend" clothes, while poorer/people in the countryside rewore and repurposed old garments. So, I tried to make it look like Guard had a more recent iteration of this world's styles.

      <br>• The main characters' house was one of the hardest things to design, since I don't have a ton of experience designing interiors, but I wanted it to be interesting and have character (especially since there are so many indoor scenes)
      <br>• A lot of the panels were referenced off a model of their house I made in <a href="http://www.sweethome3d.com/">Sweet Home 3D!</a> I highly recommend it for this purpose- they have a library of free-to-use models and and allow a "camera view" of the room you design (so you can look at it at any angle)
      <br>• One big thing I regret was not taking into account what angles of their house would be shown the most during the comic itself. I spent so long doing research on medieval homes and thinking about how the house would change after Hunter moved in that I forgot that most of the scenes take place at the table with only the window in the background. :''''') TBH that's why I added vines and stuff in the comic- the wall was so blank without them.
      <br>• Hmm....looking back on it, those arched flower windows would have been a lot more interesting AND easier to draw than the lattice window, RIP

      <br>• Some old drawings of these two! 
      <br>• My headcanon is that the fur-lined outfit is what Hunter wears post-story, after Doctor stops sewing for her and she gets a chance to figure out what she wants to wear/how she wants to express herself
